    "Hi! Thanks for reading this!\n",

    "In mid-February 2020, I got the call of a lifetime -- I was going to be on Jeopardy! Since I was young, I've been besting my peers at trivia. Soon, I was besting my parents too. Getting on Jeopardy! was an absolute dream for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then everything changed when the COVID-19 attacked. \n",
    "\n",
    "The week after that call, I was told that filming was taking a pause as they figured out this whole pandemic business. Okay, I thought, that gives me time to study. Plus, I didn't turn my contestant story document in on time, so really, this was a win. \n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2021, I got another call from the Jeopardy! producers, inviting me to film. At that time, I wasn't vaccinated. I work at a science non-profit with public-health adjacent projects, so I couldn't in good faith fly to Cali just to be on a game show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in late July 2021, I got the call again. Now that I am vaccinated, I might as well! Of course, as my luck would have it, as I'm prepping for my television debut, Matt Amodio is in the midst of a legendary run. I am hoping someone [Nancy Zergs](https://j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=120) him before I film, but in the event that doesn't happen, I'm doing my damnedest to beat him. \n",
    "\n",
    "**I've built this little app to do a few things:**\n",
    "    - Give me 10 top-level difficult questions at a time. Top-level difficulty means the $1000 and $2000 clues.\n",
    "    - Bombard me with sports and geography trivia (two categories in which I am extremely lacking)\n",
    "    - Simulate the bulk of a game with 12 categories chosen at random.\n",
    "    - Track my progess in my trouble categories. \n",
    "    \n",
    "I'm *planning* on winning 5 games of Jeopardy! If that doesn't happen, maybe you'll do it. Feel free to use this little app to get some practice in. If you think it helped you, [please shoot me an email!](mailto:k4thrynkohn@gmail.com) \n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, and a huge shout out to Luke Lavin, who built out the API this program is using. This is my first time using an API and he's been a huge help with his [clear documentation and nice looking website](https://cluebase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Please send all kudos to him! "
